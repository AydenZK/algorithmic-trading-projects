    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Value investing refers to investing in stocks that are trading below their perceived intrinsic value.\n",
    "- This was popularised by famous investors such as Warren Buffet and Benjamin Grahim\n",
    "- Creating algorithmic value investing strategies relies on a concept called multiples.\n",
    "- Multiples are calculated by dividing a company's stock price by some measure of the company's worth\n",
    "- Some common multiples include Price-to-earnings, Price-to-book-values, Price-to-free-cash-flow\n",
    "- Composites are using various multiples as each have their pros and cons\n",
    "- This strategy will use a composite of 5 different value investing metrics\n",
